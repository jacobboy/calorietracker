* TODO Recipe, ingred storage
  copy recipe is broken

* TODO Bugs
** Clicking away from input does not lead to onBlur and amount reset
** Searching for quaker steel oats and clicking more details results in TypeError
     108 | private static findNutrient(nutrients: ReportNutrient[], nutrientId: string): string {
     109 |   return nutrients.filter(function(nutrient: ReportNutrient) {
     110 |     return nutrient.nutrient_id === nutrientId;
   > 111 |   })[0].value;
     112 | }
   because apparently not all reports come back with all macros included
   Update: this one passes now, now heinz ketchup is broken
           calories is missing
** Can't create two ingredients with the same name?
** Search filter creates duplicates after saving an ingredient that is already saved

* TODO Refactorings
** `amountOf` needs to not do type checking.  Perhaps Ingredient has `scaleTo(amount?: number): this`?
** have Recipe implement FoodCombo and Ingredient
** RecipeIngredient for partially loading Recipes
** clean up scaleFood and ScaledIngredient usage
*** IngredientRow stores a food and a scaledFood
*** StoredIngredientRow stores a food and a scaledFood
** don't remove from meal by index?
*** Does FoodCombo need to exist? If so, Why doesn't IngredientTable use it?
    Represent Meal as Food[]?
** convert window storage saves to promises
** find consistent solution to conversion/portion nomenclature

* TODO Features
** should I be passing around objects that are an ingredient + an amount?
   then i won't need to be careful about scaling foods to 0, can always just take the original food
   see scaleFoodTo
** copy recipe uses previous amount as well
** enhanced keyboard navigation
   arrows, readline, vim keybindings to navigate
** simultaneously create multiple recipes
** recent recipes / ingredients
** delete recipe / ingredient
** edit ingredient name
** scale search row to see if it matches your food before saving
** set default amount of NDBIngredient
*** wtf did i mean by this?  is return from USDA always 100?
** convert meal to recipe
** save date with custom ingredients
** search pagination
** unit conversion / options
** Recipe and ingredient input validation
*** ensure every field has values
** what other units can we get from the USDA
** edit meals ingredients
** a11y?  use titles for "Fat: 12", etc?

* TODO figure out test issues
** how to mock local storage?
*** currently in setupTests, is this run before every suite?
*** ConnectedComponents hit localStorage on load, how to avoid this?
** will setting client.sendIngredient = jest.fn() affect other tests?
** how to patch a function in a tsx file?
*** using jsx files to avoid TS not letting me overwrite client.saveIngredient
