* Use new FDC API
* Ability to remove ingredients
* alternate measurements (cups, liters), and indivisible units (1 egg, 1 pancake)
* improved USDA search
* login and user-specific data
* document how to set up backend and appcfg, or at least the need for it
** Also look into Cloud SDK, apparently appcfg is deprecated?
* search doesn't allow copy recipe?
